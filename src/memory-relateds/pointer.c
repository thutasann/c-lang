    ## Pointer
    - a `variable-like` reference that holds a memory address to another variable, array etc.
    - some tasks are performed more easily with pointers
    - * = indrection operator (value at address)
    ### Advantages of using pointers
    - less time in program execution
    - working on the original variable
    - with the help of pointers, we can create data strcturs (linked-list, stack, queue)
    - returning more than one values from functions
    - searching and sorting large data very easily
    - dynamically memory allocation
